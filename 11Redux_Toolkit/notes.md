like for react we have react-dom and react-native

same for redux (independent library)-> to connect we have react-redux
-> diff between react-redux and redux-toolkit
--------------------------
state management , central store hona chahiye

-------------
importance of uses of two libraries:
jab redux aaya tha to uske stepup me thoda jayada time lagta tha compare to contex api and debugging karne me v problem ja rhi thi. tab developers ne redux-toolkit introduce kiya jisme setUp or debugging easy ho gya kuchh redux functions ke dawara, isliye redux use karne ke liye ye dono libraries install karni jaruri hai.

----------------

1. Store bnao
2. Slicee - name,initialstate,reducer
3. State aur action milega reducers m
4. Individual refucers ko export krlo
5. Reducer ko bhi export krnaa (main source)
6. Components m usedispatch nd useselector use krlooo... Useselector m state ka access hoga
